# VISION

*VISualize your ambitION*

# I. Introduction
This python package is designed for quick visualization of scientific data. It is based on the popular matplotlib library, but with a more user-friendly interface.

# II. Requirements

Recommended python version: 3.10 (which is used by myself)

Anyway, in theory it should work with any python version >= 2.7.

Required packages:
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

# III. Installation
```bash
```
